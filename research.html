	<h4> Current and Upcoming Projects </h4>
	<p>
		
	<b> Agricultural Diversity and Productivity </b> 
	</br>
	A study of the relationship between the composition of agricultural landscapes and agricultural production for the conterminous 
	United States. This project is conducted in collaboration with <a href="https://eburchfield.github.io/index.html"> Emily Burchfield</a>, 
	Assistant Professor in the Department of Environment and Society at Utah State University. 
	</br>
	<b>Urban Flood Mitigating Ecosystem Services</b>
	</br>
	A study evaluating the benefits of the flood mitigating secondary effects of a home buyout program. Tentative end date of Spring 2019.
	</br>
	<b>Trajectories of Sustainable Resilience</b>
	</br>
	A evaluating the impact of a home buyout program on trajectories of sustainable resilience to flooding in an urban community. 
	Tentative end date of Spring 2019.
	</br>
	<b>Scales of Social Vulnerability</b>
	</br>
	A study developing new dasymetric mapping methods for production of improved resolution social vulnerability maps on an open-source platform, 
	evaluating the performance of dasymetric mapping models, and investigating the impact of scale of social vulnerability maps on hazard planning. Starting
	Summer 2019.
	</br>
	<b>Social-Natural Co-construction of Community Flood History</b>
	</br>
	A study examining the flood history of a community, estimating the relative impacts of flooding over time, and identifying
	human responses to flooding and the resulting impacts of these responses on natural and social features of the community. 
	Starting Summer 2019.
	</br>

		<h4> Recent Projects</h4>
		<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/vuln.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>  
		
		<b> Sustainable Resilience</b> A study examining dependencies between the concepts of Resilience, Vulnerability, and Sustainability and development of a proposed dynamic assessment framework 
		for social-environmental systems that includes elements of all three concepts.
		</br>

		<b> Water Rights</b> A study examining the relationship between the hierarchical structure of water right, drought conditions,
		and vegetation health in California's Central Valley.
		</br>

		<b>Inland Waterway Operational Procedures </b> A project examining the influence of Waterway Action Plan operational procedure
		guidance on shipping activities on inland waterways. Developed an agent-based model of tow traffic on the waterways that responds to changing tow
		operation procedures that may result from severe river and weather conditions.
		</br>
		
		<b> Dasymetric Social Vulenrability Mapping </b> A project extending dasymetric mapping techniques for <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001551">high resolution social vulnerability mapping</a>.
		</br>
		
		<b> Transportation Vulnerability </b> A project that developed a screening tool for <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/4/3/28/htm"> regional transportation vulnerability assessments</a>.
		</br>
