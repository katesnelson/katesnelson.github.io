<h3>PhD Research Assistantship Available!</h3>

	<ul>
	<li> 	 The Nelson Research Group is searching for a highly motivated PhD student with interests in agricultural resilience and sustainability to contribute to a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary project studying how and why landscape simplification affects ecosystem health and agricultural productivity. 
		The successful applicant will be admitted to the <a href = https://www.k-state.edu/geography/> Department of Geography and Geospatial Sciences </a>  program in geography at Kansas State University, located in Manhattan, KS.

		This project will examine agricultural systems across the United States to identify potential benefits of, and barriers to, landscape diversification.  
		The successful applicant will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions related to the impact of landscape simplification on sustainable agriculture and how farmer management and decision making affects landscape diversity.
		
		Candidates should have a background in geography, engineering, environmental science, agricultural science, or a related field. 
		Strong candidates will have experience with statistics, GIS, or programming (eg. Python or R). The successful applicant will be expected to collaborate with the project team to conduct statistical modeling, conduct field interviews, and present and publish research results.
		
		A competitive graduate research assistantship, including annual stipend, tuition, and benefits will be provided. 
		To apply, please email a cover letter describing your experience, qualification, and interest in the position and a CV to Katherine Nelson (ksnelson@ksu.edu).
