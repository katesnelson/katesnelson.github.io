								<p>
								Today's world of fast-paced social and environmental change can often seem chaotic and out-of-control, however I 
								firmly believe that it is possible to steer that change in more positive directions that provide long-term 
								benefits for both society and the environment. My research attempts to contribute to the body of knowledge on
								sustainable planning and policy development for socioenvironmental systems by evaluating the impacts of existing 
								regulations and programs designed to manage the distribution of natural resources and impacts of natural hazards 
								and by investigating the underlying conditions and processes of systems that lead to improved sustainability outcomes.
