								I am an Assistant Professor of Nature-Society Interactions in the Department of Geography and Geospatial Sciences at Kansas State University.
									My work addresses the impacts of planning and policy on the sustainability of socio-environmental systems by 
									examining the effects of policies on hazard impacts, evaluating adaptation strategies, and developing
									decision support tools to help reduce vulnerability and increase resilience. I frequently employ geospatial 
									programming and analysis methods on large spatiotemporal datasets that integrate social and physical data.

								My current research focuses on (1) how land-use influences agricultural production and urban flood mitigation, 
								(2) how flood adaptation strategies alter urban system resilience and vulnerability trajectories, and 
								(3) how scale-of-analysis alters our understanding of social vulnerability to hazards.

								I welcome inquiries from students interested in joining the <a href=http://www.k-state.edu/geography/>Department of Geography and Geospatial Sciences 
								at Kansas State University</a> as Masters or Ph.D. students. Students with interests in:
								geospatial programming and analysis, social vulnerability, community 
								resilience and sustainability, agricultural sustainability, and flood adaptation can contact me
