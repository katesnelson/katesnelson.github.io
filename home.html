								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>
								I am an Assistant Professor of Nature-Society Interactions in the Department of Geography at Kansas State University.
									My work addresses the impacts of planning and policy on the sustainability of socio-environmental systems. 
									This includes investigations into the effects of policies on hazard impacts, evaluations of the 
									effectiveness of adaptation strategies, and development of decision support tools to help reduce 
									vulnerability and increase resilience. I frequently employ geospatial programming and analysis methods 
									on large spatiotemporal datasets that integrate social and physical data to address these questions. U
									nderlying themes in my research are the influence of scale-of-analysis, place-based context, and spatial 
									correlation on study findings.  
								</br>
								My current research focuses on (1) how land-use influences agricultural production and urban flood mitigation, 
								(2) how flood adaptation strategies alter urban system resilience and vulnerability trajectories, and 
								(3) how scale-of-analysis alters our understanding of social vulnerability to hazards.
