								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University where I study Environmental Management and Policy. 
								My studies have emphasized consideration of multiple disciplinary perspectives (engineering, environmental science, management, law, and sociology) and adoption 
								of methodolgical techniques from these and other disciplines (such as policy analysis and epidemiology). My research focuses on analysis of social structures 
								that interact with the built and natural environment to promote or harm social equity, ecological health, and long-term viability of social-environmental systems 
								with a methodological emphasis on consideration of spatial and temporal dependencies. I will be on the job market in Fall 2017.</p>
